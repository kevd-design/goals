# Goal Journal

A structured journaling system for personal and professional goals.

## About This Project

This repository hosts a structured goal journaling system designed to track, document, and reflect on personal and professional objectives. The system enables clarity, reflection, and accountability through daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly goal planning.

## Why Goal Journaling?

Maintaining a structured goal journal provides several benefits:

1. **Clarity** - Clearly articulated goals transform vague aspirations into actionable plans
2. **Accountability** - Regular documentation creates personal accountability
3. **Reflection** - Systematic reviews help identify patterns, strengths, and areas for improvement
4. **Adaptability** - Visible history of goals enables better adaptation to changing circumstances
5. **Progress Tracking** - Visual representation of accomplishments over time

## Features

- **Multi-timeframe Planning** - Track daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly goals
- **Progress Updates** - Document accomplishments and milestones
- **Reflection Sections** - Dedicated spaces for journaling insights
- **Focus Shifts** - Record and explain strategic pivots
- **Visual Formatting** - Clean, readable layout with clear organization
- **Mobile Accessibility** - Optimized for viewing and updating on the go

## Technical Implementation

- Built raw HTML & CSS
- Hosted on GitHub Pages for version control and easy updates

## How It Works

The goal journal operates on a simple principle: document intentions, track progress, and reflect on outcomes. Each entry includes:

1. **Goals** - What you aim to accomplish
2. **Progress Updates** - What you've achieved
3. **Reflections** - What you've learned
4. **Time-Based Scheduling** - How you plan to use your time

By maintaining this documentation, you create a feedback loop that improves focus and helps optimize future planning.

## Context

This goal tracking initiative serves as:

- A structured journaling system to set and track personal and professional goals
- Daily goals are written with assistance and archived to goals.kevd.design
- Each day's entry becomes a version-controlled snapshot, ensuring clarity and traceability
- Enables mobile, voice-based journaling and goal-setting with AI during daily routines like walking the dog
- Acts as both a reference point and a durable accountability mechanism
